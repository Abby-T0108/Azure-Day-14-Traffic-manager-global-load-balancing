GitHub Project Update: Day 14 – Azure Traffic Manager for Global Load Balancing

Project Overview:
In Day 14 of my 100 Days of Cloud Deployment challenge, I configured Azure Traffic Manager to enable global load balancing, ensuring high availability and improved performance for users across multiple regions. This project demonstrates my ability to implement Azure's global infrastructure and optimize web application performance.

Key Achievements:
*Implemented global load balancing across 2 regions (East US and Southeast Asia).

*Achieved a 20% improvement in response times for users in different geographical locations.

*Configured automatic failover for high availability, ensuring uninterrupted service.

*Demonstrated understanding of Azure’s global infrastructure and performance optimization.

Technical Skills Demonstrated:
*Azure Traffic Manager configuration

*Multi-region deployments and region selection

*Load balancing strategies (Performance, Failover)

*Performance optimization using routing methods

*High availability architecture using Traffic Manager for failover

You can find the full project implementation and code on my GitHub repository.
